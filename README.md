# Permissions

Write permission must be given for writing pull request comment. There are multiple ways:
1. Enable "Read and write permissions" in Repository Settings > Code and automation > Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
2. Add `permissions: write-all` to the job. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs).
3. If you want more control over the permissions, you can add just the required permissions instead. Please note that this will set all other permissions to none by default:
    ```yaml
    permissions: 
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    ```
